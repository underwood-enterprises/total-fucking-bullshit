            <h1>What Kind of Bullshit are C4/C3 and Other Diagrams?</h1>

            <p>
                In the world of software architecture, we're constantly bombarded with new methodologies, frameworks,
                and visualization techniques that promise to make our systems more understandable. C4, C3, UML, ERD,
                DFD—the alphabet soup never ends. But how much of this is actually useful, and how much is just another
                layer of abstraction that wastes our time?
            </p>

            <h2>The C4 Model: Complexity Disguised as Clarity</h2>

            <p>
                The C4 model, created by Simon Brown, stands for Context, Containers, Components, and Code. It's
                marketed as a "simple" way to document software architecture using a hierarchical approach. But let's be
                honest: is adding four layers of diagrams really making anything simpler?
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's the breakdown of what each level supposedly offers:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context:</strong> The big picture. Your system and its users. Okay, this one's actually
                    useful.</li>
                <li><strong>Containers:</strong> The high-level technical building blocks. Web apps, mobile apps,
                    databases, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> Groups of related functionality within a container.</li>
                <li><strong>Code:</strong> Classes, interfaces, etc. (Rarely diagrammed because, you know, that would be
                    too much work.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The problem isn't that these diagrams are inherently bad—it's that they often become an end unto
                themselves. Teams spend weeks perfecting their C4 diagrams, only for them to become outdated the moment
                the first line of code changes. And let's not pretend these diagrams are "living documents" that get
                updated regularly. We all know they'll rot in a Confluence page somewhere.
            </p>

            <h2>C3 Architecture: The Lesser-Known Cousin</h2>

            <p>
                C3 (Context, Container, Component) is essentially C4 without the code level. It's like C4 admitted that
                nobody was going to diagram at the code level anyway, so they just lopped it off. At least they're being
                realistic.
            </p>

            <p>
                The issue with both C3 and C4 is that they create a false sense of understanding. Drawing boxes and
                arrows doesn't mean you understand how the system works—it means you understand how to draw boxes and
                arrows.
            </p>

            <h2>The Diagram Addiction</h2>

            <p>
                The software industry has a diagram addiction. We seem to believe that if we can just visualize our
                systems in the right way, all our problems will be solved. But diagrams don't solve problems—engineers
                do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here are some common symptoms of diagram addiction:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Spending more time updating diagrams than writing code</li>
                <li>Having meetings about how to diagram rather than what to build</li>
                <li>Using diagrams as a substitute for clear written documentation</li>
                <li>Believing that a good diagram can compensate for a poorly designed system</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The reality is that most diagrams become outdated almost immediately. They're snapshots of a system
                that's constantly evolving, and they rarely evolve with it.
            </p>

            <h2>When Diagrams Are Actually Useful</h2>

            <p>
                I'm not saying all diagrams are useless. Far from it. Diagrams can be incredibly valuable when:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>They're created for a specific purpose, not just because "we should have diagrams"</li>
                <li>They focus on one aspect of the system rather than trying to capture everything</li>
                <li>They're used as communication tools during discussions, not as artifacts to be preserved</li>
                <li>They're simple enough that they can be recreated quickly when needed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The best diagram is often the one drawn on a whiteboard during a discussion, captured in a photo, and
                then erased. It served its purpose: facilitating understanding in that moment.
            </p>

            <h2>The Alternative: Documentation That Matters</h2>

            <p>
                Instead of obsessing over the perfect architectural diagram, we should focus on documentation that
                actually helps developers do their jobs:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decision records:</strong> Why did we choose this technology or approach?</li>
                <li><strong>API documentation:</strong> How do I interact with this system?</li>
                <li><strong>Setup guides:</strong> How do I get this running locally?</li>
                <li><strong>Troubleshooting guides:</strong> What do I do when things go wrong?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These are the documents that developers actually use day-to-day. They're practical, specific, and
                directly applicable to the work being done.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Use Diagrams, Don't Be Used By Them</h2>

            <p>
                Diagrams like C4 and C3 can be useful tools when used appropriately. The problem arises when they become
                mandatory deliverables that consume more time than they save.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next time someone insists that you need to create a complete set of C4 diagrams for your system, ask
                them why. What specific problem are these diagrams solving? Who will use them? How will they be kept up
                to date?
            </p>

            <p>
                If the answers are vague or amount to "because that's what we do," you might be dealing with a case of
                diagram bullshit. And in that case, feel free to send them a link to this article.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember: diagrams should serve you, not the other way around. Use them when they help, ignore them when
                they don't, and never let them become a substitute for building good software.
